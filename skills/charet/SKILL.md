name: charet
description: Work with charet, a code-first design board where an app's real React UI is rendered with mock APIs as screens, flows and component stories that a team reviews and comments on. Use this skill whenever the user mentions charet or a charet project, design or UI review comments to handle, screens, flows or stories, a `.charet/` folder or a charet checkout, putting an app on charet (import), or wants a UI change checked, captured or shown to the team — even if they only say "check the screen", "the designer left comments" or "make this reviewable".

# charet

A charet project is a real app (React + its own components) plus a `.charet/` folder that declares
**screens** (a page in one state, rendered with mock API data), **connections** between screens,
**flows** (the order a user goes through a feature) and **stories** (component states). The team
looks at them in the web tool and pins **comments** to elements. You change code in a checkout;
the `charet` CLI is how you see what the team sees.

| Who | Does |
|---|---|
| Team (web tool) | browse screens, flows and stories; click an element to comment |
| You (code) | edit the app and `.charet/` in a checkout, `charet push` to a branch |
| You (CLI) | read structure and comments, check and capture, reply and resolve |

The server keeps its own copy of the project. Changes travel as branches: a push from a checkout of
main starts a branch (a draft) and the checkout follows it; the team reviews it in the web tool,
and merging it makes a new version of main. The product repository is not touched by charet; a
checkout is a working copy of charet's copy, not of the product repo.

## Start here

```bash
charet status            # inside a checkout: its branch (if any), newer versions, local changes
charet comments          # open comments (exit 1 while some are open)
charet ls                # screens, stories, flows and whether their captures are current
```

- Commands run inside a checkout use its project and server. Elsewhere add `-p <project>`
  (and `--server <url>` when the server is not the default `http://127.0.0.1:5280`).
- No checkout yet: `charet projects`, then `charet checkout <project> <dir>`.
- If `charet status` says main moved, `charet pull` before editing — it saves a refused push later.
- "Cannot reach the charet server" → `charet doctor` says which part is down.
- "Enter your token first" / "token was reissued or removed" → a team server: ask the person for
  the token an admin gave them and run `charet login --token <token>`; CI uses `CHARET_TOKEN`.
- On a team server, `charet inbox` lists what concerns the person (new comments, answers in their
  threads) with links — a quick way to find what to handle first.
- Every command takes `--json` when you need to parse the output.

## Workflow 1 · Handle comments

1. `charet comments`, then `charet comments show c12`. It saves the snapshot the comment was made
   on and prints its path, the pinned element, its component chain (outermost › innermost) and
   the source location.
2. Read the snapshot image. A comment is about *that element in that state*; the text alone is
   often ambiguous ("make this clearer").
3. The innermost component is often a shared primitive (Button, Card). Fix it there only when the
   comment is really about the primitive — a shared change alters every screen using it.
4. If you cannot tell what is wanted, ask on the comment instead of guessing:
   `charet comments reply c12 -m "…"`. The team reads replies where they left the comment.
5. Fix the code, push, verify (Workflow 3).
6. `charet comments resolve c12 -m "what changed (branch #n or vN)"` — after you have looked at
   the result. The note is what the reviewer reads to decide whether to reopen.

If a reply or resolve fails with "changed meanwhile", someone touched the comment. Re-read it and
act on the latest content.

## Workflow 2 · Build a UI feature (flow first)

A flow written before the code is the plan the team can review; planned steps are your to-do list.

1. In `.charet/project.tsx`, add or extend a flow. Steps that do not exist yet are planned:
   `{ id: "export-dialog", title: "Export dialog", note: "CSV, date range" }`.
2. Build the UI in the app.
3. Add a screen with the **same id** as each planned step: its page, mocks for the state it shows
   and, if it needs interaction to reach that state, a `setup`. Add connections from the screens
   that lead to it. Empty, loading and error states are screens of their own.
   (`references/project.md`, `references/mocks.md`)
4. Push and verify (Workflow 3); `charet flow <id> --sheet /tmp/flow.jpg` shows the whole flow.
5. When the feature changes shape (a step added, split or dropped), change the flow too, so it
   keeps describing what was built.

## Workflow 3 · Verify a UI change

```bash
charet push -m "what and why"       # from main: a new branch #n; in a branch checkout: adds to it
charet check <id…>                  # renders this checkout's branch: errors, console, missing mocks
charet branch review                # ask the team to look (the push printed the branch link)
charet branch merge                 # once agreed (or `charet push -m … --merge` when working alone)
charet capture <id…> --out /tmp/cv  # after merging: update what the team sees on main
charet ls --stale                   # screens whose capture is older than the code
```

- Push first: `check` builds and renders what was pushed (the checkout's branch), so an unpushed
  fix is invisible to it. `capture` stores what everyone sees, so it only runs on main.
- Merge only when the user (or the team, in review) agreed; a draft is the safe default. When the
  user asked for the change outright and works alone, `charet push -m "…" --merge` does both.
- Merge refused with a clash: someone changed the same lines on main. `charet branch catch-up`,
  `charet pull`, settle the files named in the message, push, then merge again.
- `[charet] missing mock GET /api/…` means the screen calls an API no handler answers. Add the
  handler; a silent failure there would show the team a broken screen.
- Open the saved pictures and look at them before saying it works. A page can pass `check` and
  still be wrong (empty table, clipped dialog, wrong state).
- A shared component change makes many screens stale: `charet capture $(charet ls --stale)`.
- Add `--theme both` when the change can look different in dark mode.
- Push refused because someone pushed to the same branch first: a checkout is a git work tree, so
  `git stash && charet pull && git stash pop`, then push again. Their commit stays; yours lands on
  top.
- A version that broke something: `charet restore vN` makes a new version undoing it.

## Workflow 4 · Put an existing app on charet

`charet import <app>` copies the app into charet; then you add `.charet/` (charet-only dependencies,
vite config, frame, project, mocks) in the checkout, push (with `--merge`) and check. The app's own `package.json`
and lockfile stay exactly as in its repository. Follow `references/import.md` step by step — it
covers getting the SDK, the files to write and the usual failures.

## Understanding structure

```bash
charet show <id|c12>              # details, connections in/out, flows, sources, open comments
charet connections --from <id>    # transitions (click · auto · error)
charet path <from> <to>           # how a user gets from one screen to another
charet map --format mermaid       # every page and screen with connections
charet source <screen>            # the files a screen renders from; `charet source <path[:line]>` reads one
charet url <id>                   # link to give the team
```

Connections and flows are written by hand and can lag behind the UI. When one looks wrong, check
the app code (router, buttons, links) and answer from the code. If you are already changing the
project, fix `.charet/project.tsx` too. If you were only asked a question, say what is wrong and
offer the fix (or leave a charet comment) instead of pushing a change nobody asked for — even a
draft branch shows up for the whole team.

## Ground rules

- Change comments and captures only through the CLI or the web tool; the server tracks revisions
  and pin positions.
- Leave your own questions or notes on the screen (`charet comments add <id> --at x,y|selector -m
  "…"`), not only in chat, so the team finds them where they look.
- Deleting a project (`charet delete`) cannot be undone; do it only when the user asks.
- Vague requests ("clean this up", "make it nicer"): tidying charet itself is fine — missing or
  stale captures, connections that disagree with the code. Changes to how the app looks or behaves
  are design decisions: list them, or leave them as comments on the screens, and let the user
  choose before you change the app.
- Report back with what changed, the branch link (or version, once merged), and `charet url <id>`
  links for the screens.
